JavaScript Password Generator


I was tasked with creating an application to generate a random password, based on user selected criteria.  
With growing concerns surrounding digital security in many business, learning the foundations of secure passwords can be very beneficial.


Details of Project

We were given the starter html code, along with a CSS file, and a very limited JavaScript file.  (see photo attached in Github).

We used the power of JavaScript to make a dynamic application, where the user could interact with the page, helping to choose the features of the password.

For example, the user was asked "if they wanted to have capital letters as part of their password".  They could chose yes or no, and it would not affect the password generated.  (See attached photo.)

I chose to use multiple functions to help to generate the password.  With there being several arrays used in this project, and many possible characters used, I had to be careful not to mixup the names of the different functions, arrays, etc.

In the end, the application ran well, but I was unable to get the application to generate a password.  It ran through the entire interaction with the user, but failed to generate the password.  I will continue to check the code, and work on a solution. Stay tuned.

One last note, feel free to view the application on any device, as it is responsive.
