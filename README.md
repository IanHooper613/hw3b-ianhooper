Password Generator


JavaScript Password Generator


I was tasked with creating an application to generate a random password, based on user selected criteria.  
With growing concerns surrounding digital security in many business, learning the foundations of secure passwords can be very beneficial.


Details of Project

We were given the starter html code, along with a CSS file, and a very limited JavaScript file.  (see photo attached in Github).

We used the power of JavaScript to make a dynamic application, where the user could interact with the page, helping to choose the features of the password.

For example, the user was asked "if they wanted to have capital letters as part of their password".  They could chose yes or no, and it would not affect the password generated.  (See attached photo.)

I chose to use multiple functions to help to generate the password.  With there being several arrays used in this project, and many possible characters used, I had to be careful not to mixup the names of the different functions, arrays, etc.

**new**
After reworking and simplifying my code, I was able to get my code working and have the application print out a password.  One key to this was breaking down the project step by step, instead of jumping in and starting to create functions everywhere.  By doing this, I was able to reduce my original code by half, and get better results.  This will definitely be something that I try to replicate for future projects.
